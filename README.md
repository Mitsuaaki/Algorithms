This package allows you to use various algorithms in mathematics, machine learning, computer science and physics with Julia. <br>

If you want to support the development of this package, please star the repositories, road to 100 !

ðŸ“š Thanks to [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) to allow the constant generation and updating of documentation.

## How to install this package in my project ?
```julia-repl
(@v1.7) pkg> activate MyProject

julia> add https://github.com/Mitsuaaki/Algorithms
```

## If there are any problem in putting the documentation online
```julia-repl
(@v1.7) pkg> activate path/to/Algorithms

julia> include("path/to/Algoritms/docs/make.jl")
```
After that you just have to search on your web browser `path/to/Algorithms/docs/build/index.html`

## Some explications
For the moment this repository is still in development, you can of course contribute by creating pulls_request however I intend to develop all the algorithms I thought of so if a pull_request is made while the code was planned it will be refused

This repository is to train me to give free access to all those who want to use the code for personal use.

## ToDo

* Fix & complete the documentation
* Add more algorithms
* Find some motivations for the development of this package
