ðŸ“š Thanks to [Documenter.jl](https://github.com/JuliaDocs/Documenter.jl) to allow the constant generation and updating of documentation.

## Some explications
For the moment this repository is still in development, you can of course contribute by creating pulls_request however I intend to develop all the algorithms I thought of so if a pull_request is made while the code was planned it will be refused

This repository is to train me to give free access to all those who want to use the code for personal use.
