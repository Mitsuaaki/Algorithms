# Algorithms

*Various algorithms in mathematics, machine learning, computer science and physics written in Julia*

A package for using a wide variety of algorithms in your academic, professional or personal projects.

!!! note

    You can easily understand the algorithms coded in this package without even knowing the Julia programming language. 
    I advise you however if you have misunderstandings to join the [Discord](https://discord.gg/NqRhMaDpBr), 
    or to make research on Internet before stupidly copying code or trying to adapt it in another language.
